I have added all the five api's required. 
In this approach, i have used in-memory storage. However, 
we can scale this in production environments to use sql or aws storage. 
For this commit i have assumed that the file size is considerably smaller and can be 
handled in one-go. 
As a enhancement to this, we can consider the file data in chunks and handle.
